Build Instructions:

$ go build -o throughput avg_throughput.go
$ ./throughput
OR
$ go run avg_throughput.go


Output:
Average networking throughput going through a box will be printed on the command line every second. ctrl + c will quit the tool.

Throughput:
Throughput is defined as the actual amount of data transferred by a box over a period of time. 

Throughput Calculation:
1. The tool uses received bytes at all interfaces to calculate throughput.
2. It parses the proc/net/dev file every second to extract received bytes of all interfaces and sum them to show throughput for that time interval.

Throughput = Bytes Received / Time

Average throughput Calculation:
In calculation, we can use any of the three theoretical formulas:
1. Simple average: Summation of Bytes Received / End time
2. Simple average: Summation of (Bytes Received at end time - Bytes Received at begin time) / (End time - Begin time)
3. Average: Current throughput = A(last bytes received) + (1-A) Current throughput ; A ~ 0.25.

I have used simple average as in formula 2.

Test:
Tested on Linux x86_64 bit machine running Ubuntu 14.04, by generating different traffics using ping and iperf.
